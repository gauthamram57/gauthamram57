## About Me

I am focused on building a strong foundation in cybersecurity with emphasis on penetration testing, SOC operations, and threat analysis. My approach is hands-on and practical: I learn by experimenting with systems, studying real-world attack techniques, and understanding how defenses are designed and implemented.

I use this GitHub to document my learning journey, projects, and experiments as I steadily build depth in security engineering and defensive operations.
